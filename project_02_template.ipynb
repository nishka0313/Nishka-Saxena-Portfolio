This indicates that we are 90% confident that the true proportion of startups securing a deal lies between 47.10% and 54.34%. Additionally, our hypothesis test produced a p-value of 0.903. We can assume that the median number of companies that receive a deal on Shark Tank in one season is around 15. This is much greater than our significance value, 0.05. As a result, we fail to reject the null hypothesis; there is not enough information to conclude that the true median is different from our hypothesized value."

    "**Limitations:** Regarding our data, we didn't face challenges in terms of cleaning or handling it, as there weren't troublesome variables or many rows of data we had to drop to use this datast. However, there are a few limitations to this analysis that affect how strongly we can interpret the results. First, this dataset only contains Season 1 though 6 of the show Shark Tank. This means that in later seasons, there could be newer features of the show, and due to its high popularity, it might become harder to secure a deal on Season 7 than it was during Season 1, when the show was just starting to air. Additionally, there could be potential bias for what entrepreneurs are offered deals, as some companies could be more \"popular\" or create drama that attract more viewers to the show. This could affect the entrepreneurs that are looking to pitch their deal on Shark Tank as it would give them more insight towards their chances of securing a deal, but they would still need to conside media and popularity-centered bias. As for investors, they would have a better idea of what kinds of deals are pitched, and whether or not they would be successful.\n"

    "**Future Work:** Future projects could explore which industry type is likely to get a deal. This would explore if a specific industry is more likely to secure a deal over another industry. Another direction is tracking the success of the company after appearing on the show. Have companies that secured a deal gone to do better than companies that did not secure a deal? Although our dataset does not have company information after going on the show, this is an interesting topic that researchers can explore. In addition, comparing different seasons or international versions of Shark Tank could provide insights into how investor behavior and startup trends vary across time and regions."
