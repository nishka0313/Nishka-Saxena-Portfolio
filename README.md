## 📊 1. Stroke Prediction
**Goal:** Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on health and demographic data.  
**Highlights:**
- Data preprocessing, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.
- Exploratory data analysis to identify key health indicators.
- Model comparison using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics.

## ⚗️ 2. Mass Spectrometry Analysis
**Goal:** Analyze mass spectrometry data to detect and interpret significant peaks for chemical and biological insights.  
**Highlights:**
- Signal processing for noise reduction and baseline correction.
- Peak detection algorithms for identifying compounds.
- Data visualization to represent spectra and peak distributions.
- Interpretation of patterns for potential compound identification.

## 🌌 3. Star Classification
**Goal:** Classify stars into categories (e.g., White Dwarf, Main Sequence, Supergiants) based on their temperature, luminosity, radius, and other astrophysical features.  
**Highlights:**
- EDA with stellar parameter distributions and HR diagrams.
- Data normalization and feature scaling for model training.
- Application of Decision Trees, KNN, and Support Vector Machines.
- Confusion matrix and classification report for performance assessment.
