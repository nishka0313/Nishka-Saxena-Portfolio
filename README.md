# Data Science Portfolio

This repository showcases my applied data science, analytics, and machine learning projects, with a focus on real-world problem solving, statistical modeling, and predictive analytics. Projects emphasize data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model building, and clear interpretation of results. All work is implemented in Python using VS Code.

## 1. Shark Tank Deal Analysis
**Goal:** Use statistical inference and regression models to analyze startup funding outcomes and investment decisions.  
**Highlights:**
- Confidence interval estimation and hypothesis testing
- Bootstrap resampling and simulated sampling distributions
- Linear regression to analyze relationships between valuation, equity, and funding
- Logistic regression to predict deal outcomes, evaluated using ROC–AUC
- Clear interpretation of coefficients, diagnostics, and limitations

## 2. Stroke Prediction
**Goal:** Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on health and demographic data.  
**Highlights:**
- Data preprocessing, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.
- Model comparison using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics.

## 3. Mass Spectrometry Analysis
**Goal:** Analyze mass spectrometry data to detect and interpret significant peaks to understand fraction sample data.  
**Highlights:**
- Peak detection algorithms for identifying compounds.
- Data visualization to represent spectra and peak distributions.
- Interpretation of patterns for potential compound identification.

## 4. Star Classification
**Goal:** Classify stars into categories (e.g., White Dwarf, Main Sequence, Supergiants) based on their temperature, luminosity, radius, and other astrophysical features.  
**Highlights:**
- EDA with stellar parameter distributions and HR diagrams.
- Data normalization and feature scaling for model training.
- Confusion matrix and classification report for performance assessment.
